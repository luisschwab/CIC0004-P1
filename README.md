# CIC0004 - P1
Project for my Algorithms class.

Takes in class codes (max 10 chars)  and the respective schedules, one by one, and prints out a nice time table, notifying the user if there are any schedulling collisions.

# Usage

Adding the class CIC0128B, for exemple: `+ CIC0128B 246T45`

And then removing it: `- CIC0128B 246T45`

Print the table: `?`

To exit the program, just press enter or type in any random string.
